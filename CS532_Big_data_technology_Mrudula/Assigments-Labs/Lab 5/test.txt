Those with database experience will notice that this is a violation of the first normal form as defined by E.F. Codd. This intentional denormalization of data is very common in OLAP systems in general, and in large data-processing systems such as Hadoop in particular. RDBMS systems tend to make joins common and then work to optimize them. In systems such as Hadoop, where storage is cheap and joins are expensive, it is generally better to use nested data structures to avoid the joins.
