Big Data

According to SiliconAngle, there was 2.5 zetabytes of stored data world over in the year 2012 and it is set to hit the 8 zetabytes mark by the end of 2015.

To put things in perspective, this data has largely been produced by websites and cross platform transactions. Add to it the fact that there would be a total of 20 billion “smart” devices connected to the internet by the end of 2020 and the numbers can be baffling!

Given that Facebook alone produces about 15 TB data on a daily basis today, imagine a situation where our refrigerators, microwaves, cars, fitness devices and a host of other connected devices start producing and storing data every second!
